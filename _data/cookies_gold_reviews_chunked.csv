I was excited to try Bakehouse's treats, but unfortunately, most of their products fell flat. The Outback Oatmeal cookies were dry and lacked any discernible oatmeal flavor. The Austin Almond Biscotti was overly crunchy and tasted more like cardboard than almond. The Orchard Oasis cookie was a confusing mess of flavors, with none of them working together. The Golden Gate Ginger cookie was the only decent one, but even that was overpowered by an overwhelming ginger spice. The Tokyo Tidbits were stale and lacked any Japanese-inspired flair. And don't even get me started on the Pearly Pies - the crust was soggy and the filling was bland. For a bakery in a popular tourist district like Dogo Onsen, I expected much better.
