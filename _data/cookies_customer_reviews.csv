"""5/5 stars for Bakehouse in Norwood, Adelaide! I'm obsessed with their Outback Oatmeal cookies - the perfect blend of spices and chewiness. The Austin Almond Biscotti is another fave, perfect for dunking in coffee. However, the Orchard Oasis cookies were a letdown, too sweet and crumbly. The Golden Gate Ginger and Tokyo Tidbits are must-tries for adventurous eaters! Pearly Pies are a game-changer for dessert lovers.

Bakehouse in Kitano, Kobe, has won my heart with their exceptional cookies. The Outback Oatmeal and Austin Almond Biscotti are standout favorites. The Outback Oatmeal cookie, with its perfect balance of oats and sweetness, is a hearty treat that never disappoints.
